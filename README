Courses can be reordered in editing mode via drag and drop (with appropriate fallback when ajax disabled for the user).

Each course can be expanded to show a list of activity icons alerting the user to updated modules or modules requiring attention.

Optionally can display the shortnames of child courses under the heading of the course (site-wide option).

Optionally can display a welcome area above the courses that welcomes the user and alerts them of any pending messages.
